# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination

At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

## Loading the data


```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

The data frame `omega`  contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. Can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives?

Note that you can perform different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion 

.	Confidence intervals
.	Hypothesis testing
.	Correlation analysis
.	Regression


Calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, you show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)


omega %>% 
  # calculate needed statistics in each group
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  
  summarise(
    #calculate number of observations in each group
    n=n(), 
    
    # calculate mean and standar deviation of salary in in each group
    mean=mean(salary), 
    sd=sd(salary),
    
    # calculate t-critical value in our case
    t_critical=qt(0.975, n-1),
    
    #calculate SE and margin of error in each group
    se=sd/sqrt(n), 
    margin_error=se*t_critical, 
    
    # calculate confidence interval in each group
    lower_ci=mean-margin_error, 
    upper_ci=mean+margin_error)
```

> The lower bound of the average salary for male is higher than the upper bound of the average salary for female, so there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives.

You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.
